# CoinCurrencyAssignment1

#### What Works

* Program successfully asks and processes input from the user making sure the input is a valid integer in the range of 1 – 95 and for AU$, a value that is a multiple of 5
* Program successfully displays “error” message if the user inputs an invalid integer
* The program loops correctly if the user wants to continue and ends if the user specifies that they do not want to continue 
* The program successfully calculates how many coins of each type of coin should be returned and displays this to the user
* The program correctly gives as many of the higher valued coins as possible



What Does Not Work
* Could not create a separate function that displays the results as we have not learnt how to return multiple values of the same type from a function
